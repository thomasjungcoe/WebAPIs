Drawing graphics
    The browser contains some very powerful graphics programming tools, from Scalable Vector 
    Graphics (SVG) language, to APIs for drawing on HTML <canvas> elements. 

    While you could use CSS and JS to animate (and otherwise manipulate) SVG vector images 
        -- as they are represented on markup -- there are  still no way to do the same for
        bitmap images, and the tools available were rather limited.
    
    This improved as browsers began to support the <canvas> element and assocaited Canvas API 
        in 2004 `
