Drawing graphics
    The browser contains some very powerful graphics programming tools, from Scalable Vector 
    Graphics (SVG) language, to APIs for drawing on HTML <canvas> elements. 

    While you could use CSS and JS to animate (and otherwise manipulate) SVG vector images 
        -- as they are represented on markup -- there are  still no way to do the same for
        bitmap images, and the tools available were rather limited.
    
    This improved as browsers began to support the <canvas> element and assocaited Canvas API 
        in 2004 

    Drawing paths
        If you want to draw anything more complex than a rectangle, you need to draw a path.
        
        Basically, this involves writing code to specify exactly what path the pen should move 
        along on your canvas to trace the shape you want to draw.

        Canvas includes functions for drawing straight lines, circles, Bezier curves, and more.
