Working with Third-party APIs

Objective:
    To learn how third-party APIs work, and how to use them to enhance your websites.


1.) mapquest folder covers how to utilize a third party API using a dev key from mapquest.

2.) nytimes folder covers another example of using a third party API but in a RESTful way.
    * On creation of dev key, "Article Search API" option has been enabled for this micro project.
    
    - grab reference to all the DOM elements to manipulate later
    - add event listeners to control the functionality
    - fetch data
    - display results by creating elements of those div, a, img, p, etc, etc
        append those nodes into article 
    - nextPage && prevPages button (at 10+ results) calls fetching data function.

3.) youtube folder will be used to study and learn two related APIs
    * The 'Youtube Data API' to search for YouTube videos and return results
    * The 'Youtube Iframe Player API' to display the returned video examples 
        inside IFrame video players so you can watch them.
